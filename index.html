		<h2>Aspiring Web Developer and Civil Engineer</h2>
		<div class="personal-statement">
		<p>I have been employed as a civil engineer for 16 years starting when I was a junior in high school.  My career began as a design drafting technician and progressed into obtaining my engineering degree, licensure as a professional engineer and on to project management and office management. </p>
		<p>I am now looking at changing careers and becoming a Web/Application developer.  My desire for a career change began with the start of a flight school in my hometown, Butte, MT.  I developed a website for this business, <a href="http://www.jjaviation.com" target="_blank">JJ Aviation</a>, and found that I very much enjoyed the challenge of web development.  I then tried my hand at android application development in order to build a partner application for the website.  I have enjoyed teaching myself HTML but I recognize that I will need additional guidance if I am to continue to learn developer skills.  To that end I am enrolled in the <a href="http://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> program and have been searching for opportunities to be a virtual intern for a development company.</p>

			<h3><a href="http://www.jjaviation.com" target="_blank">JJ Aviation Website</a></h3>
				<p>Created to support a flight school started by my husband and I.  The website was my first exposure to web development and was created using self-taught HTML.</p>

				<p>Created as a mobile version of the JJ Aviation Website.  The application was created using Buzztouch and very little code writing was required.  However, the content has been popular and since itâ€™s publication, the application has over 1,000 installs.  My intention is to enhance the application in the future with additional features and links.</p>
